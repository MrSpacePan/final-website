			<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
			<p> Welcome to my website, my name is Chris and I like a lot of things but I also like writing about them.
			Here I'll share my thoughts on whatever I'm interested in that week, it could be movies, TV, games, books,
			music, podcasts, it could be anything. I also plan on going into software development, and have an interest
			game development, so anything I do relating to that will go up here to. Hope you like my website, I will try
			to update it weekly.</p>
